			Welcome to my first official website! I hope you enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed making it!<br>
            My name is Ryan Broda, I'm 23 years young, and a new student here at Grand Circus' full time front end coding bootcamp in Detroit Michigan.<br>
            I've decided to take the opportunity to show you the three things I love most in the pictures below. I've always been an avid baseball fan, and my team is the Detroit Tigers.<br>
            Next is my love for music. Music has always been a huge part of my life, from helping out in the monotony of everyday life to my journey learning to play several different instruments such as the guitar, keyboard, alto saxophone, and drums.<br>
            Last but certainly not least is my love for food. I love the smell, the taste, and even the memories associated with sitting around the dinner table with family and friends. I can honestly say there isn't a single food that I have come across that I didn't like!<br>
            Well that's a little bit about me, check out my website, add me on facebook, or send me any questions you may have.
